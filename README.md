# :label: Github Repo Autolabeler

Take control of your Github repositories and take the stress out of creating **new** Github labels!

### :raised_hands: Get Started

```bash
# clone the repo, and then run
$ ./labeler.sh
```

Not working? :thinking: you might need to update permissions first: `chmod 777 labeler.sh`

### :heart: Thanks!

Like this repo? Star it for later!
